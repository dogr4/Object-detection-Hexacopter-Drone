# ESP32 CAM Based Object Detection & Identification with OpenCV.
OpenCV is an open-sourced image processing library that is very widely used not just in industry but also in the field of research and development.
Here for object detection, we have used the cvlib Library. The library uses a pre-trained AI model on the COCO dataset to detect objects (YOLOv3).
We have installed it in the Object-Detetion Hexacopter drone for the real time object dection.
